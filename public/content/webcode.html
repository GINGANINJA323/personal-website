      <h1>Website Code</h1>
      <p>I wrote this website using ReactJS and TypeScript.</p>
      <p>It is styled based on a Windows 95/98 desktop environment, something I am especially fond of.</p>
      <p>The codebase can be found <a href="https://github.com/GINGANINJA323/personal-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
