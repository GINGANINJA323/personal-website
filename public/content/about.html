      <p>In terms of my career, I currently work at BT as a full-stack software engineer. I predominantly work with Node and Node based technologies. I recently finished my apprenticeship in which I gained a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Technology Solutions - Software Engineering with a 2:1.</p>
      <p>I have experience in a range of technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>ReactJS</li>
        <li>React Native</li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As for hobbies, I am an avid gamer as software engineers typically are, particularly with RPGs. I am also a retro-gamer, with two retro computers to play games such as Duke Nukem 3D and DOOM.</p>
